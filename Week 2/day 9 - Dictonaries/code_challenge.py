# You have access to a database of student_scores in the format of a dictionary. The keys in student_scores are the names of the students and the values are their exam scores.

# Write a program that converts their scores to grades. By the end of your program, you should have a new dictionary called student_grades that should contain student names for keys and their grades for values. The final version of the student_grades dictionary will be checked.

# DO NOT modify lines 1-7 to change the existing student_scores dictionary.

# DO NOT write any print statements.

# This is the scoring criteria:

# Scores 91 - 100: Grade = "Outstanding"

# Scores 81 - 90: Grade = "Exceeds Expectations"

# Scores 71 - 80: Grade = "Acceptable"

# Scores 70 or lower: Grade = "Fail"

# Expected Output
# '{'Harry': 'Exceeds Expectations', 'Ron': 'Acceptable', 'Hermione': 'Outstanding', 'Draco': 'Acceptable', 'Neville': 'Fail'}'

# student_scores = {
#   "Harry": 81,
#   "Ron": 78,
#   "Hermione": 99, 
#   "Draco": 74,
#   "Neville": 62,
# }

# student_grades = {}

# for key in student_scores:
#   if student_scores[key] <= 70:
#     student_grades[key] = "Fail"
#   elif student_scores[key] <= 80:
#     student_grades[key] = "Acceptable"
#   elif student_scores[key] <= 90:
#     student_grades[key] = "Exceeds Expectations"
#   else:
#     student_grades[key] = "Outstanding"

# print(student_grades)
